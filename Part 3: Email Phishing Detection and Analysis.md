# Email Phishing Detection and Analysis

## Introduction
Email phishing remains one of the most common attack vectors used by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to systems, steal sensitive information, or distribute malware. In this project, you will learn how to detect and analyze phishing emails using various techniques and tools, including VirusTotal.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts, including phishing.
- Familiarity with email protocols (SMTP, IMAP, etc.).
- Access to an email account (can be a personal or test account).
- Knowledge of using web browsers and navigating online platforms.

## Lab Set-up
- Email Account: Set up a test email account to send and receive phishing emails. Gmail or Outlook accounts are suitable for this purpose.
- VirusTotal Account: Sign up for a free account on VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com) to access its features for analyzing suspicious files and URLs.
- Virtual Machine (Optional): For safely opening and analyzing email attachments, consider using a virtual machine environment to prevent any potential harm to your main system.

## Exercises: Analyzing Suspicious URLs with VirusTotal

Objective: Use VirusTotal to analyze a suspicious URL found in a phishing email.

Scenario: You receive an email claiming to be from a reputable financial institution, requesting urgent action to verify your account details by clicking on a provided link. You suspect it's a phishing attempt and want to analyze the URL to determine its legitimacy.

Step 1: Receive the Phishing Email:

- Log in to your test email account and locate the suspicious email.
- Do not click on any links or download any attachments from the email.

Step 2: Extract the Suspicious URL:

- Identify the URL provided in the phishing email.
- Copy the URL to the clipboard for analysis.

Step 3: Analyze the URL on VirusTotal:

- Open a web browser and navigate to the VirusTotal website (https://www.virustotal.com).
- Paste the suspicious URL into the search bar and initiate the analysis.

Step 4: Review the Analysis Results:

- VirusTotal will analyze the URL against multiple security engines and databases.
- Examine the analysis report for any detected malicious behavior, such as phishing, malware distribution, or suspicious redirects.
- Pay attention to the detection ratio and community comments for additional insights.

Step 5: Assess the Legitimacy:

- Based on the analysis results, evaluate whether the URL is legitimate or malicious.
- Consider factors such as the reputation of the sender, the urgency of the request, and any red flags identified during the analysis.


Expected Solution:

- If VirusTotal reports a high detection ratio or indicates that the URL is associated with phishing or malware, it is likely malicious. Avoid clicking on the URL and report the email as phishing to your email provider.
- If VirusTotal reports a low detection ratio and no malicious indicators, exercise caution but use additional verification methods (e.g., contacting the organization directly) before interacting with the URL.
  
By completing this exercise, you'll develop skills in analyzing suspicious URLs using VirusTotal and strengthen your ability to detect phishing attempts in emails. Remember to always exercise caution and verify the legitimacy of email communications, especially when they contain URLs or attachments.
